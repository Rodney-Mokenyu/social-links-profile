- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I continue to learn how to build flexible single webpages with mobile first work flows.
Not yet perfect but getting there.
I learned about display style (inline-block), i never knew about it.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<p data-profileName="profile_name" id="profile-name">
            Jessica Randall
          </p>
          
          
<address data-address="address" id="address">
            London, United Kingdom
          </address>
     
     
          ```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  a {
    color: rgb(250, 250, 251);
    text-decoration: none;
    transition: color 0.3s ease, transform 0.3s ease; /* Smooth transition */
    display: inline-block;
}
}
```
